## Compatibility

## Getting started

Below is a simple example that describes the instantiation and most basic usage of our SDK:

Run `go get github.com/splitio/go-client/`

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/splitio/go-client/v6/splitio/client"
    "github.com/splitio/go-client/v6/splitio/conf"
)

func main() {
    cfg := conf.Default()
    factory, err := client.NewSplitFactory("YOUR_SDK_KEY", cfg)
    if err != nil {
        // SDK initialization error
    }

    client := factory.Client()

    err = client.BlockUntilReady(10)
    if err != nil {
        // SDK timeout error
    }

    treatment := client.Treatment("CUSTOMER_ID", "FEATURE_FLAG_NAME", nil)
    if treatment == "on" {
        // insert code here to show on treatment
    } else if treatment == "off" {
        // insert code here to show off treatment
    } else {
        // insert your control treatment code here
    }
}
```
